They were called "wild beasts" (*fauves*), for they didn't daintily dot a canvas with paint—they attacked it, aggressively brushing vivid color into mere suggestions of form. Henri Matisse was the leader of these artists, who transformed traditional painting by emphasizing the expressive power of color over the realistic depiction of their subject matter. It was the first revolutionary art movement of the 1900s: Fauvism. And although it seemed wild, even brutish, Matisse was aiming for balance, purity, serenity. *Three Bathers* is from Matisse's immediate post-Fauvist period, when he shifted toward radical simplification and used broad blocks of color to indicate land, water, and sky. Thick contour lines, both pictorial and sculptural, define the bathers and Matisse's struggle to reconcile multiple dimensions with two-dimensional design.

## Inspiration on Layaway

Matisse’s Three Bathers was inspired by Paul Cezanne’s Three Bathers, a painting that Matisse bought when he could scarcely afford it. He signed a promissory note for 1,200 francs and paid off the debt in installments.

## Strokes of Genius

Matisse went big in this painting, laying down large, flat swaths of color. But he also worked in an homage to Cezanne, who was known for dashed brushstrokes that captured dancing color and created a sense of movement. You can see it best in a series of similar brushstrokes behind the seated woman at right, adding color and giving a sense of dimension to the rock.

## Figure Study

The three women may seem awkwardly posed, but the different body language of each woman represents a different state of being: hunched with her back toward the viewer, the woman is extremely closed and passive; standing straight in the middle, she is forward and active; seated upright, she is open and contemplative.

## Starting Small

The MIA’s Three Bathers was likely a study for *Bathers with a Turtle*, a similar but much larger painting at the St. Louis Art Museum. With these paintings, Matisse began a period of artistic experimentation that culminated with his monumental painting known as *Dance (I)* at the Museum of Modern Art.

## Day at the Beach

Matisse painted this beach scene in Collioure, a village on the coast of southern France.
