<p>Bling fit for a king. Heavy with bead and shell pendants, this <i>yet</i> belt was once part of the elaborate outfit worn by the king of the Kuba people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. None of the pendants match, a show of creativity and innovation prized by Kuba leaders. In fact, the notoriously fashion-conscious kings often help create patterns and symbols that become part of their personal “brand,” broadcasting authority and influence. Only the king and a few select members of his entourage can wear his signature designs.</p>

## Pendants
<p>Kuba kings accumulate pendants on their belts throughout their reigns. And if it’s hard to imagine hefting the 23 on this belt, that’s nothing compared to the record of 80 pendants. The shapes and patterns have symbolic meanings—the ram’s head, or<i> paang</i>, shown here is a common royal emblem.</p>

## Rings
<p>The two interlocking rings, known as an <i>imbol</i>, comprise another common Kuba royal symbol.</p>

## Music
<p>This is a miniature version of a bow lute called a <i>lakaweemy</i> or <i>pluriarc</i>, one of the traditional royal instruments used to announce the king’s arrival at official events.</p>

## More Music
<p>This double gong, or<i> nkop</i>, pendant is a miniature version of another royal instrument.</p>

## Crouching Frog
<p>The king is decisive and his influence cuts deeply—or so suggests the crouching frog shape of this pendant and its bold blue-and-white “razor’s edge” pattern.</p>

## Shells
<p>Kuba art often playfully imitates nature, like this beaded pendant in the shape of the natural shell beside it.</p>
