Can cars be art? The Tatra T87 answers the question with a glance. In fact, its design and engineering were both ahead of its time, the aerodynamic style reducing air resistance while dropping jaws. From the three-piece windshield to the fin in the back, every feature blends forms and function, and because of its performance-enhancing features the Tatra T87 was one of the fastest cars of its day. Capable of 100 miles per hour, it was ideal for the newly opened Autobahn, the German federal highway system, which for the most part has no speed limit.

## The Back Fin

This eye-catching tailfin actually helped stabilize the car at high speeds—something you’re used to seeing, for similar reasons, on airplanes.

## A Functional Face

The center headlight improved visibility in fog. The aerodynamic three-piece windshield also increased visibility while reducing air resistance.

## A Sculpted Body

Other notable features on the Tatra include skirted rear wheels to enhance aerodynamics, side air scoops on the back for engine cooling, and recessed handles. It also has an all-metal, single-piece body.

## A Study in Symmetry

Most cars are balanced, few are symmetrical. The Tatra, as seen from the front or rear, is perfectly so: even the exhaust pipe is centered. The dashboard, save for the steering wheel, is just as obsessively symmetrical.

## V8 Engine

The Tatra T87 has a powerful three-liter V8 engine, air-cooled and rear-mounted. Though it only produced 85 horsepower (a modern Mustang can surpass 400), the engine propelled the car to 100 miles per hour. Comparably fast cars had bigger, thirstier engines; the Tatra sipped while it zipped at 19 miles per gallon.
