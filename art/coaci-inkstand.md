You wouldn’t use this inkstand to write your grocery list. At more than two feet tall, made of silver, red marble, and lapis lazuli—a semi-precious blue stone—it’s one of the most imaginative examples of Italian decorative arts from the 1700s. Silversmith Vincenzo Coaci designed it in 1792 to commemorate a monument made several years earlier, when Pope Pius XV had a recently discovered ancient obelisk moved to the Quirinal Piazza, next to his summer residence. There, it was surrounded by two huge horsemen that had stood in that spot since their creation around 400. Topped with a cross, this rearrangement of ancient artifacts from the pagan past was an expression of papal power and a triumph of engineering.

## The Quirinal Plaza

The inkstand is a precise miniature copy of the monument in the Quirinal Plaza, featuring a Roman obelisk—unearthed in 1783 near the Great Mausoleum of Emperor Augustus—and two large statues of the Gemini twins, Castor and Pollux, which had been commissioned by Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome. 

## Leather Case

The original leather case depicts a walled Ottoman city. Leather usually doesn’t withstand the ravages of time as well as silver or stone, yet this case has retained all of its stunning detail. 

## Secret Access

The inkwell is rigged with delightful surprises. A lever slides the Gemini twins apart to reveal the actual inkwell and sand compartment (a fine sand would be sprinkled over letters to absorb any extra ink).

## Lovebirds

Another lever moves two birds together for a kiss.

## Hidden Functionality

The Coaci Inkstand is, unbelievably, quite functional. The marble base also doubles as a desk. 

## Goddess of the Arts

The inkwell is full of references to the goddess Minerva, the ancient Roman name for Athena. She was associated with handicrafts and the arts, as well as classical learning and wisdom. Here, the lion holds a serpent—a common symbol of Minerva—in its jaws. 

## Hidden Illusions

Perhaps the most exciting secret is a compartment etched with *tromp l’oeil* (French for an optical illusion that “fools the eye”). The imagery includes Coaci’s calling card with a picture of the ruined Temple of Venus (actually a bath) in Baia, Italy; Salvator Rosa’s drawing of an old warrior; a *roscone* (a stylized rosette commonly found on antique temples); and a musical score that may have been composed by Coaci himself.
