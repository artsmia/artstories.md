When young Johann Friedrich Baer called this cup of his a “masterpiece,” he wasn’t being boastful. Every craftsman angling for membership in a professional guild had to produce a “master piece” to demonstrate his skill. The guild for metalsmiths required a covered cup, even though they had long been out of style. The panel reviewing Baer’s cup in 1746 declared his work to be excellent (despite a few microscopic holes in the casting) and he was accepted as a Master of the Echasse Guild, just like his father and brother before him and his son after him. Baer kept the cup until he died.

## Victory is mine!

On the cover, the mythological hero Hercules slays the three-headed monster Cerberus. Baer inscribed the cover: “With this club I strike my enemies under me,” referring to Hercules’s victory but possibly also to Baer’s triumph over jealous colleagues with this masterpiece.

## In Touch with Nature

Pan, the Greek half-goat/half-human god of wild places, perches on the stem of the cup eating grapes in a bower of bulrushes, acanthus leaves, and grape vines. Such florid images from nature were popular during the brief period of Rococo style.

## The Customer is Always Right

Baer’s cup was a terrific advertisement, illustrating just about every type of scene a potential patron could have wanted, from ancient mythology to recent battles. At the time, Europe was embroiled in a war to settle whether Maria Theresa, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, would become the first and only female ruler of the Habsburg Empire.

## Good Enough for Paris

The inscription at the base of the cup was added later, when the cup was displayed in Paris. But it was wrong: “Johann Friedrich Baer invented and made it, in Strasbourg, in the year 1756,” it declared in French. The actual date was 1746.

## Show and Tell

The silver-gilt cup liner is detachable, like a modern-day cup koozie— probably not for insulating but so the judges could see how the piece was made.
