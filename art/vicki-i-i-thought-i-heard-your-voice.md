“Is he the worst artist in America?” *Life* magazine asked this in the title of a 1964 article about Roy Lichtenstein. It’s hard to imagine how shocking his work was in the 1960s—the low-brow subject matter, the dubious artistry involved in basically copying someone else’s work. But Lichtenstein was playing with heady issues that preoccupied generations of artists before him, pinpointing the shifting intersection between abstract form (lines and dots on canvas) and meaning (or lack thereof).

## All True Love Stories!

Trashy romance comics thrived alongside pulp fiction and radio soap operas from the 1940s through the mid-1970s. They appealed to Lichtenstein because their imagery seemed as far from “art” as an image could get.

## Mechanical Process, Done By Hand

The use of small, colored “Ben-Day dots” allowed printers to cheaply simulate more expensive color printing techniques in comic books and other inexpensive publications. Lichtenstein imitated (and exaggerated) the effect by hand.

## What a Cliché!

That Lichtenstein could get away with “copying” a comic strip—and call it art—caused a bit of a scandal. In fact, he rarely copied a comic directly, instead subtly altering the image to heighten the clichés.
