<p>To the Kongo people, St. Anthony was known as Toni Malau, or “Anthony of good fortune,” and he became popular at a time when the Kongo people needed all the luck they could get. In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.</p>

## Rubbing with Oil
<p>The faces of Toni Malau and the Christ child in his arms were repeatedly rubbed with oil, acts of devotion that left them darkly stained.</p>

## Nose and Arms
<p>Sculptures of Toni Malau were believed to have powers of healing and protection. On this figure, the Christ child’s nose and right arm were gradually scraped away by his devotees.</p>

## Bible
<p>As in many European depictions of St. Anthony, the Christ child held by Toni Malau is kneeling on a Bible.</p>

## Cape
<p>The netted cape worn over Toni Malau’s shoulders was traditionally made of raffia and reserved for Kongo nobility.</p>
