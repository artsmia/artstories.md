To the Kongo people, St. Anthony was known as Toni Malau, or “Anthony of good fortune,” and he became popular at a time when the Kongo people needed all the luck they could get. In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.

## Rubbing with Oil

The faces of Toni Malau and the Christ child in his arms were repeatedly rubbed with oil, acts of devotion that left them darkly stained.

## Nose and Arms

Sculptures of Toni Malau were believed to have powers of healing and protection. On this figure, the Christ child’s nose and right arm were gradually scraped away by his devotees.

## Bible

As in many European depictions of St. Anthony, the Christ child held by Toni Malau is kneeling on a Bible.

## Cape

The netted cape worn over Toni Malau’s shoulders was traditionally made of raffia and reserved for Kongo nobility.
