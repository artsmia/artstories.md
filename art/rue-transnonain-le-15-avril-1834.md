It could hardly be more gruesome: a child lies dead beneath the corpse of his father; his murdered mother lies in the shadows. They were among the family of 19 men, women, and children killed by French troops during the 1834 Paris worker uprising, ostensibly for their involvement in an attack on soldiers. Three generations had lived in close quarters under one roof, and the eerie quiet of a family sleeping at night belies the shock of this scene, which became a universal symbol of inhumanity.

## Time of the Crime

The simple and evocative title, *Rue Transnonain, le 15 Avril, 1834*, references the location and date of the massacre, quickly bringing the horrific details to mind.

## Scene of the Crime

Daumier sets the murder in the moonlit interior of a working-class home. The social status of the family is implied in the modest furnishings and the fact that three generations share the same small apartment.

## Surprise Attack

The victims are barefoot in their pajamas, the bed is unmade—this was a nighttime surprise attack, and, judging from the overturned chair, it didn't end without a violent struggle.

## Dramatic Lighting

The moon is the only light source, spillng in through an unseen window or skylight. No candles, no lanterns—the victims were asleep when attacked. In a black-and-white lithograph, the strong contrasts of light and shade accentuate the drama of the scene.

## Politics and Art

Government censors initially approved publication of Rue Transnonain, but King Louis Philippe later ordered the confiscation and destruction of the lithographic printing stone and all unsold impressions of the print. Only a few original impressions survive.

## The Father

The central and largest figure in the scene is the dead father, bathed in bright moonlight. As the head of the household, he represents the family, their security, and well-being and recalls traditional depictions of the dead Christ, linking the innocence of Jesus with that of the family.
