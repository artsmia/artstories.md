Knives, forks, spoons, flasks, a pistol—more than 70 ordinary objects are carved into this writing desk, like sculpture. Why? As with most folk art, the answer is more complicated than it would appear, divorced from art history trends and almost inscrutably personal. William Howard worked at Kirkwood Plantation in Mississippi as a freed man after the Civil War, where he was likely inspired by the furniture. The symmetry and structure of his desk echo the Federal stye, popular two generations earlier, that was inspired by classical Greek and Roman art. By taking an ornamental approach to these unassuming utensils, as only he thought to do, he turned his desk into a masterpiece of American folk art.

## Cotton Crates

This desk is the ultimate DIY project. Behind the polish and classic looks are rough, make-do materials such as shipping crates. “COTTON PIECE GOODS/FROM/THE GLENWOOD WO[RKS]/MEDFORD. MASS” is stenciled on the underside of the desk, marking a crate from the Glenwood Works textile company that once held cotton goods.

## Tobacco Boxes

Howard made creative use of tobacco boxes inside the desk. A label in the topmost cubbyhole reveals its origin: “Blackwell’s Genuine/BULL DURHAM,” a brand of loose-leaf tobacco from North Carolina that was popular with soldiers on both sides of the Civil War. 

## Explosive Flasks

Small but deadly, these flasks held gunpowder for muzzle-loading guns in the days before pre-packed cartridges became standard in the 1800s. They may have been more dangerous for the shooter than the enemy: one accidental spark and the flask became a suicide bomb. 

## Dentil "Teeth"

Those small, square “teeth” along the upper border of the desk are dentils, no brushing required, though Howard had evidently brushed up on Federal design. The colonial American style featured dentils—originally used in ancient Greek and Roman architecture—as decoration.

## Boat Shuttle

Not a way to cross water, this boat shuttle would neatly store thread for weaving. Howard would have seen a lot of these in the 1800s, when weaving was a booming business in America.

## Hanging in the Balance

How do you weigh cotton? Hang a bale on one end of the scale and add weights to the other until everything balances out.

## Signs of the Times

Not everything carved into the desk was a tool. Take these trade symbols, displayed outside stores in the 1800s to quickly note the services rendered inside. The glove on Howard’s desk was the trade sign for, you guessed it, a glove maker.
