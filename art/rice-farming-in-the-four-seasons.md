They once formed the walls of the so-called “Bamboo Room,” a reception chamber in the Daikaku Temple in Kyoto. But they had disappeared from the temple long before the MIA acquired them. These 16 sliding screens depicting rice farming form a continuous agricultural panorama and were likely painted by Kanō Sanraku, who decorated other rooms in the temple around 1620. In 1755, they were given to the artist Ōoka Shunboku (1680–1763) in exchange for additional decorating work at the temple and were later combined into four four-panel screens. After the MIA acquired them in 1980, they were restored to their original format as sliding screens.
