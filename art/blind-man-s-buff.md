The cabaret is swinging—hard enough that time has lost meaning and modern sophisticates consort with mythological figures. Amid these pleasure-seekers stand two young people carrying candles. The girl is oblivious to the clamor, steadfastly waiting; the boy is blindfolded but determined to find her—they have a predestined connection. These two give the painting its title, after the old game in which a blindfolded child stumbles through the darkness to find and “tag” other children. When asked if the couple would ever find each other, the artist Max Beckmann said “Perhaps; let us hope it.”

## Rule of Three

Beckmann made nine great triptychs, three-paneled paintings traditionally used as altarpieces. This is one of his largest and most important, and his only triptych representing one continuous space. In a way, Beckmann brought the medieval Gothic altarpiece into the 20th century, using the traditional format to express his complex personal philosophy. 

## Classical Mythology

Beckmann called the center figures “the gods,” and the animal-headed man “the minotaur” (despite its horse head). Like the Greek pantheon of gods, they govern destiny and symbolize the conflicts between passion and reason, chastity and vice, lust and true love.

## Infinite Time

The large clock is missing the Roman numerals I and XII (1 and 12), suggesting time without beginning or end, such that classical figures cavort in a cabaret orchestra before the eyes of modern viewers.

## Early Sketches

Beckmann rarely produced preliminary sketches or studies for his paintings, but he made two small studies of this central panel. In these early compositions, he placed the clock and harpist differently than he settled on later.

## Evolution of a Painting

Beckmann’s journals reveal his evolving views about the painting and its subject. He changed the title six times between 1944 and 1945, from *The Concert* to the *Great Café*, from the *Great Bar* to the *Great Cabaret*, and finally from the *Ox-Feast* to *Blind Man’s Buff*.
