*In the autumn of 1082, on the 16th of the seventh month, Master Su and his guests sailed in a boat below the Red Cliffs. Clear wind blew gently, the water was calm. The boaters raised their wine and poured for each other, reciting “The Bright Moon” and singing “The Lovely One.”  *

So begins the poet Su Shi’s Former *Ode to the Red Cliff* (translation by Pauline Chen), describing boating parties he took with friends along the Yangzi River beneath the famous Red Cliff. The scene on this dish depicts the poet in court robes with two companions, a wine pot and cups before them. The boat drifts idyllically beside a rocky embankment covered with grasses, tall reeds, a willow, and a cassia tree, as a waterfall spills down from the high cliffs at the far shore.

## The Red Cliff

The Red Cliff, now a favorite tourist spot, didn’t become famous for its tranquility. Situated along the middle section of China’s Yangzi River, it was the sight of a monumental battle around 208–209 that overturned Northern rule over Southern allied states.

## Who Was Su Shi?

Su Shi was one of the most influential scholar-officials of the Northern Song dynasty during his lifetime, famed for both his statesmanship and his art as a calligrapher, writer, and poet. After Su Shi died in 1107, his reputation continued to grow as shrines and memorials were erected in his honor and connoisseurs collected his poems and calligraphy. 

## Floating Ode

The book the gentleman is holding is Su Shi’s first Ode—the three Chinese characters inscribed on the book are the title. Perhaps he is reading these lines: *They went where their tiny boat took them, floating on a thousand leagues of haze, in the vastness as if resting on emptiness and riding the wind, not knowing where they would stop....*

## Vintage Style

The thin lines incised by the artist harken back to a style of painting that emerged in the Tang dynasty (618–907). Known as baimiao, it is simple but finely controlled, relying on a supple ink outline without any color or wash. 

## The Big Dipper

*After a while, the moon rose above the eastern mountain, and hovered between the Dipper and the Cowherd star. White mist lay across the water; the light from the water reached the sky.*

That’s the translation of Su Shi’s verse—he would have called the big dipper “the northern ladle.” It’s one of the few constellations found in both Eastern and Western stargazing traditions. 

## The Flute Player

It wouldn’t have been idyllic cruise without music, so indeed there was a musician along for the ride: *Among the guests there was one who played the flute, and he played along with their song. The sound of his flute mourned, as if grieving as if loving, as if weeping as if reproaching. Its sound echoed and lingered, not breaking as if a silken thread.*

## Mythical Moon Rabbit

Seen through drifting clouds, the full moon is engraved with the mythical Moon Rabbit under the cassia tree, pounding a pestle in a mortar to mix his magic elixir of immortality.

## Leafy Rim

The dish has a foliated rim, meaning it has a leaf-like design. This, along with the image in the center, is a similar porcelain example from the time period, covered in luxurious blue-green celadon glaze.
