<p>It looks like a lumpy blob of dirt, more accident than art. But don’t let its humble looks fool you. The <i>boli</i> couldn’t have a larger, deeper purpose: it’s a portable altar and a symbol of the entire universe, imbued with spiritual energy. The <i>boli</i> came from the Bamana community in Mali and, as is often the case with indigenous African traditions, it was created by a team of artists, elders, and religious specialists to express in physical form some complex ideas and beliefs. Hidden deep inside is a small cloth doll. Over time, as bone, bark, nuts, soil, animal blood, and other natural materials are added to the <i>boli</i>, its spiritual energy increases.</p>

## Up Close
<p>The <i>boli </i>is a living thing, growing as dried earth from termite mounds, beeswax, animal blood, chewed-up kola nuts, and millet porridge are added to it in layers during rituals that honor ancestors and petition for help with medical, judicial, and other day-to-day needs. The materials dry, harden, and eventually crack the <i>boli’s</i> surface, resulting in the web of lines and subtle color variations that attest to the <i>boli’s</i> age.</p>
