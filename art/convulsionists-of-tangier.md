They were entranced, and entrancing: celebrants of the Aissawa sect of Sufi Islam on a ritual pilgrimage through the streets of Tangier, in Morocco. Eugène Delacroix saw them in 1832 while traveling with the French ambassador, the Count de Mornay, who was negotiating a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. The pilgrims were eating glass and biting their own arms, among other acts of self-abuse, to draw attention to their religion. Vividly colored and vigorously brushed, Delacroix’s masterpiece captured the commotion, even though it was painted from memory five years later—a memory not easily forgotten.

## Searching for Inspiration

Delacroix inspired August Renoir’s 1881 journey to North Africa in search of similar exoticism. This painting from Algiers shows he found it: a lively Sufi ritual filled with music and dancing. The palette is similar, too, with bright colors enhanced by stark Mediterranean light.

## Flag of the Sultan

The robed man on horseback is no mere observer: he’s a sultan, or ruler, identified by his green flag. With an eye on the pilgrimage, he’s prepared to maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos.

## Saada and Préciada

The women in this watercolor are Saada and Préciada, the wife and daughter, respectively, of Abraham Ben-Chimol, the Jewish interpreter assigned to the delegation. Delacroix had painted them in their home and later incorporated elements of their clothing into this painting.

## Convulsionists

Delacroix’s sketches include several studies of the convulsionists in motion, and one of the poses made it into the final painting.

## Attic Adventures

Count de Mornay later recalled that he and Delacroix had witnessed the pilgrimage from an attic hideaway, peeking through a boarded-up window while lying flat on their stomachs. As Europeans, he said, they were afraid they’d be killed if seen watching.
