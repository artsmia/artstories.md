The circular shapes marking the black surface only hint at the photograph’s origin. But picture this: The artist stands alone in a pitch-dark room with only a sheet of light sensitive color paper and a sharp instrument. He places the paper on the ground and rotates it as he presses the tool against its surface, as though engraving a copper plate. Remember, the artist is in the dark, so he cannot see his marks. Only when the paper’s chemicals are exposed to light do the marks magically appear and reveal layers of color.

## No Camera?

This image lacks the fundamental elements of a typical photograph. There was no camera. No subject or composing. And no development of the picture in a darkroom. Throw (C-918) only meets the definition of photography because it uses light-sensitive, photographic paper.

## Precedent: Anna Atkins

Cameraless photography has existed since the medium’s invention in 1839.  In New Zealand, Anna Atkins, who is believed to be the first female photographer, created an early example of a “photogram.” She placed a physical plant on light-sensitive paper and exposed it to the sun. The chemical result is akin to an image that looks like a fossil, the white outlines of a plant against a blue background.  

## Decisions, Decisions

Photography with a camera is about decisions. Where should I point it? At what angle? Below? Above? How far away should I stand? In Throw (C-918), the artist suggests a different set of decisions for photography: What paper to use, what tool to mark it with, and how to move it.
