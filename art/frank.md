Frank is deceiving. From afar, the portrait looks like a larger-than-life photograph, but up close you discover that it’s paint on canvas. In a sense, it’s both. Chuck Close transformed an 8x10-inch photograph of his friend, Frank James, into a painting by dividing the photo into a grid and copying each section onto the canvas on a much larger scale. He used only two tablespoons of diluted paint to cover the entire canvas, abandoning traditional brushes in favor of airbrushes, sponges, his fingers, razors, even an eraser fastened to an electric drill. The realistic finish, blemishes included, make Frank one detailed dude.

## Who Is Frank?

Frank James was an art student at the School of Visual Arts in New York when Close taught there. Close painted the portrait in his studio from a photograph he took of Frank.

## The City Reflected

Such was Close’s attention to detail that Frank’s glasses reflect a view of the city from Close’s studio window—a sly insight into the world beyond the painting.

## A Familiar Face

Ironically, Close suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, and is unable to recognize the faces of people he’s met.  Painting portraits helps him with his recall.

## Face out of Focus

Close tried to replicate how a camera or your eye would visually capture a face, with only part of it in focus, depending on the depth of field. Look closely and you’ll see that Frank’s glasses and nose are in clear focus, while the neck, ears, and shirt gradually blur.

## Larger Than Life

Close made Frank’s head 10 times larger than it appeared in the 8x10-inch photograph he worked from. The result is a bit unsettling, as the realistic-looking Frank pins the viewer with his unsmiling stare.
