![Made in China: The MacFarlane Room Wallpaper](http://api.artsmia.org/images/19404/large.jpg)

It was a very good year. Another was likely ahead. To celebrate, a Chinese noble family hosts an elaborate New Year festival in its garden. They light lanterns, stage a parade, and put on a show recounting the marvels of immortals and other legends. Who wouldn’t want this exotic scene of wealth and beauty decorating their home, literally surrounding the family as though they themselves were in the garden, toasting their good fortune?

The wallpaper was hand-painted in China in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and exported for display in rooms like this one represents, a parlor in the home of a wealthy New England merchant. The wallpaper was donated to the MIA by Mabel and Wayne H. MacFarlane, and usually recedes into the background, behind furniture also given by the MacFarlane family and set up in this room in the 1970s. The furniture has been removed to highlight the story playing out on the walls.

## South Wall - Overview

The scene takes place in a large, walled garden of the sort that aristocratic Chinese families maintained next to their homes for entertaining.

## South Wall – Pavilion and performance

Setting out snacks and drinks didn’t cut it at aristocratic Chinese parties—you needed dinner and a show. Families would have stages built in their private gardens. This one is rather simple and the atmosphere is decidedly casual, with the audience walking and talking during the performance.

## South Wall – Banners

Few are the parties today where philosophical sayings are displayed. But here, the banner at right rear notes in part, “There is a reason for everything.” And the long red banner to the right celebrates the appeal of gathering friends in great gardens.

## South Wall – Theater and Amusements

Women and men are segregated in this scene, watching the play from separate chambers. Women also didn’t gamble, but there were no such restrictions on buying a treat of sugar cane. Painted folding or flat fans provided artistic relief from warm weather.

## East Wall – Gate and Parade

New Year celebrations meant an appearance from the lion dance group, paid to make the rounds of several family festivals. The gated entrance to this massive garden is shown near the ceiling, while a lantern parade processes below.

## East Wall – Wang Zhaojun

She was beautiful—and unhappy. In the 100s BCE, Wang Zhaojun famously journeyed in winter to meet the man the emperor had arranged for her to marry. An actress plays her here, plucking a sad song on her lute, and she’s also featured on a Chinese export porcelain jug in this room.

## North Wall – Acrobats

In the scene above the fireplace, acrobats entertain the revelers. Chinese acrobatics derived from folk dances and were less a display of gymnastics than a theatrical performance, a study in grace and poise, accompanied by music.

## North Wall – Lanterns

The traditional Lantern Festival, on the 15th day of the first lunar month, coincided with Chinese New Year celebrations. To the right of the fireplace, families carry spectacularly realistic lanterns resembling blue shrimp, fish, and dragons.

## North Wall – Three Daoist immortals

The legendary Eight Immortals of Chinese lore each represent a different condition of youth: poverty, wealth, age, youth, etc. Here, to the left of the fireplace, the story of the immortals magically crossing the Eastern Sea is enacted in a parade, with three immortals standing on shells and a water-filled casket.

## West Wall – Another Daoist immortal

To the right of the doorway on the West wall, another Daoist immortal is standing on a shrimp rising from the sea. His horsehair fan was believed to resurrect the dead and turn stones into silver or gold.

## West Wall – Gatherings

A mysterious woman with a bronze mirror is carried about the grounds, families gather with lanterns, and to the far left, a gambler offers a dice shaker to potential players.
