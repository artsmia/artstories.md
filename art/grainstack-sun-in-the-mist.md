What happens to light when summer turns to autumn, the moon rises, or a soft snow falls? Monet found the answers, painting the same familiar scene near his home in Giverny in all seasons, at all hours, in all kinds of weather. A grainstack sits broadly in a field, the edges of its silhouette glowing as the sun climbs amid a cool mist to illuminate the landscape. Orange, yellow, green, and violet dance across the field as the earth meets the sky in a hazy blur. For Monet, this light was just as much the subject of his work as the grainstack itself.

## Gathering Grain

The muffin-shaped grainstack is a symbol of fertility and prosperity in France. Wheat was once literally at the center of French life: In the early 1900s, the average French citizen ate more than three baguettes each day. Glory in gluten.

## Sun in the Mist

Monet  studied how landscapes changed with the weather: a dusting of snow, overcast skies, or sunshine leading to thaw. The MIA’s *Grainstack* was his sole meditation on mist.

## Strokes like Stalks

Even the smallest individual brushstrokes join together in this composition, just as slender stalks of wheat are bundled to build a grainstack in the field.

## Unsuspected Color

In his memoirs, Wassily Kandinsky reflected on the surprising impact of color in Monet’s work. The Russian-born painter, a leader of the abstract art movement in the early 1900s, described his delight in the "unsuspected power of the palette, previously concealed from me, which exceeded all my dreams.”
