Choose your weapon—or three. This halberd, a medieval multi-tasking hybrid of axe, sword, and sharpened hook, meant certain death for an enemy. But this halberd was intended only for ceremonial display, a somewhat threatening conversation piece, in the home of a family known for its pomp and circumstance—and its reliance more on marriage than warfare to expand its dominion. It was made for Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor and a member of the renowned House of Habsburg, one of the most prominent ruling families of Europe for more than 600 years.

## Deadly Combination

An axe to chop, a sword to pierce, a sharpened hook to pull riders off their horses—this trifecta of weapons was death on a stick. In fact, that staff ensured you couldn’t get close to someone wielding a halberd unless you had one of your own.

## Just for Looks

This halberd is an impressive weapon, not just for fighting but admiring. The extensive decoration, including delicately carved leafy tendrils, point to its ceremonial use as a symbol of power and prestige.

## So FAR, so Good

The letters FAR are etched on either side of the crossed staves. They stand for "Ferdinand," "Anna" (his wife) and "Rex" ("King," his title).

## What Kind of Coronet?

The crossed staves impale a coronet, or crown, through its middle. The coronet indicates a ruler and, depending on the type, what kind of ruler he or she is. This particular coronet is a Herzogskrone, or duke’s crown.  

## Cross of St. Andrew the Apostle

Ferdinand I counted the Dukes of Burgundy among his ancestors—another celebrated marital alliance that significantly increased the Habsburg family’s territories.
