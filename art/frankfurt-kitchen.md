The destruction of World War I, combined with changing demographics, created a major housing shortage in Germany in the 1920s and 30s.  Designers and architects developed innovative living spaces to meet the needs of modern families while also keeping construction costs down. When creating her kitchen design, Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky turned to unlikely sources for inspiration: railway cars and passenger ships.  Her kitchen, later dubbed the Frankfurt Kitchen, was efficient, compact, clean . . . and equally important, could be mass-produced: it was installed in about 10,000 new apartments.  Look out the large window for a view of the new post-WWI housing complex in which this kitchen was originally placed.

## Ease of movement

The surfaces of the kitchen are designed with the cook in mind. Prep work could be done while sitting on an adjustable, moveable stool, thus eliminating aches from standing.

## Functional blue

As calming as the blue hue is, the paint was chosen for a specific purpose. Research found that flies avoid the color blue, because they do not distinguish it as solid.

## Everything at hand

Aluminum containers held common cooking and baking ingredients for convenience and easy pouring. From top left to bottom right, the bins are labeled for: Coffee, salt, semolina, dried fruit, rice, oats, baking ingredients, fine sugar, noodles, barley and sugar.

## Ironing board

The Frankfurt Kitchen was created to make all types of prep work convenient, including ironing clothes.  A mounted ironing board hides against the wall: just pull down to use.

## Preparing the meal

The majority of food preparation took place at the counter under the window. The cook could sit while peeling and cutting vegetables, and then push the scraps into a built-in receptacle to save space and maintain cleanliness.

## Putting Food in the Table

The pass-through connecting the kitchen and dining area allowed for a quick transition from cooking to placing the food on the table and eating. Some Frankfurt kitchens featured full doors, while others, like the MIA’s, included a small door that slid up into the wall.

## Drying rack

The dish drying rack sits above the sink requiring one to merely reach upward for dishes to go from washing to drying.  There they were out of the way leaving preparation space open for other functions.

## Moving Light

Don’t be caught in the dark. The ceiling light fixture is actually movable allowing one to have maximum light no matter where one is in the kitchen.
