We can now put a name to this face. For centuries, this painting was known simply as *Portrait of a Woman*. But recent research revealed the identity of this elegantly dressed lady: Lucia Wijbrants (1638–1719), the wealthy widow of a Dutch cloth merchant. She stands at her dressing table, surrounded by her personal—and rather expensive—possessions, while the frisky spaniel at her feet begs for her attention.

## Exotic Connections

The Turkish carpet draped over the dressing table stands out among the rich velvets and silks covering other furniture. But it wasn’t out of place: The Dutch traded heavily with Turkey, importing everything from silk to carpets to tulip bulbs.

## Dressed to Thrill

Lucia was well-to-do and dressed the part, here sporting a satin gown trimmed with fine gold lace, an expensive addition to any outfit. Her stranded pearl necklace and bracelet, drop-pearl earrings, gemstone bracelet, and large diamond brooch fill out the picture of a proper lady.

## A Gift of Silver

Lucia was rightly proud of her silver toilette set and made sure they stayed in the family. Lucia gifted part of the set to her stepdaughters, Johanna Maria and Sara Hinlopen, according to a document dated 1718 in the Amsterdam city archive.

## Playful Pup

Lucia’s pet spaniel frolics at her feet, inviting her to play. The image of a dog is traditionally associated with loyalty and fidelity (Fido, anyone?), and here it suggests that Lucia, too, has such noble traits.

## Portraits in Other Places

A little detective work comparing Lucia’s likeness (and that of her husband) has linked several family portraits, and the belongings in the room sealed the deal. The bed, for instance, shows up in this painting—now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art—of her husband’s family with his first wife.

## Symbol of Faith?

Tucked in the background, nearly hidden behind a curtain, is a painting of John the Baptist bearing witness to Jesus Christ (even featuring the artist’s signature)—possibly a subtle reference to Lucia’s piety and faith.
