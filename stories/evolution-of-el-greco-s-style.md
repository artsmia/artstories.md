Christ’s expulsion of the money changers was a familiar artistic theme during the Counter-Reformation, when Catholics pushed back against Protestant reformers. To Catholics, it showed the church purifying itself, with the Protestants standing in for the money changers. El Greco painted nine versions of it, each one intensifying his Mannerist style of compositional tension, instability, elongated figures, bright colors, artificial poses and space, and heightened spirituality.

The monumental draped figures and perfect single point perspective in this earliest known version are standard elements of Italian Renaissance Italian painting.

By 1570, El Greco begins to elongate and twist his figures.

The artistic moves made in 1570 are much more pronounced by 1600. The actors are further contorted and architectural space begins to warp and sag.

By 1609, El Greco’s style matured to its most idiosyncratic: sketchy figures, an almost dream-like arrangement of people in space, and a playful approach to scale. The open archway is gone, the color is muted, and the sculpture in the niche to the left looks ready to jump down into the commotion below.
