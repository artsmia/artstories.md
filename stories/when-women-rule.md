Like father, like daughter—unless the daughter is next in line to succeed her father to the throne. In 1740, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI passed away, leaving his daughter Maria Theresa as sole successor to the throne. A woman had never been named Holy Roman Emperor, but, against all odds, she was crowned archduke and king in 1741—masculine titles to satisfy those who considered her gender a serious compromise.

Charles VI had officially decreed that his daughter could inherit the family possessions, but several states including Prussia and France refused to go along with this. Perceiving Maria Theresa as weak, they saw an opportunity to challenge the powerful House of Habsburg.

For eight years, war engulfed Europe as states battled for power. It was the first true world war, spreading to the Americas and India. When it ended, in 1748, Maria Theresa governed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary over her former terrorities, except for the state of Silesia, which was given to Prussia.

The colorful history related to the House of Habsburg provided dramatic subjects for artists such as Fredrick Baer, who featured the War of Austrian Succession on his Masterpiece Cup and Cover now displayed at the MIA.
