In 2004, Alec Soth became a nominee and later a member of Magnum Photos, a prestigious and highly selective international photography agency collectively run by its members. Founded in 1947 by photojournalists Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, George Rodger, and David "Chim" Seymour, Magnum sought creative independence for its members on press assignments. Artists working for newspapers and magazines are typically required to sign over their copyright privileges to their employer. But Magnum members retain this right and future profits from image use.

Even with its diverse international membership, Magnum was known for a particular brand of image. Its members tend to work in black and white—the “color” of the news—with small, mobile cameras to shoot in the field. As photojournalists (journalists using photography to relate current events), they were renowned for their coverage of wars and tragedies.

Soth represented a new generation of Magnum photographers. He favors colors and sometimes shoots with a bulky large-format camera requiring a long set up and patient subjects. The camera provides rich detail and his pictures focus less on action and more on the deep, still content of his subject, whether a landscape or an individual.
