<p>Ivory, largely from elephant tusks though sometimes from hippopotamus tusks, has long been the favored art material of Africa. Kings controlled the ivory trade, supplying carving guilds with tusks and exporting the rest, mostly to Europe. At times it was white gold, fueling power struggles and decimating elephant herds.</p>

<p>The trade wiped out North African elephants perhaps a thousand years ago and escalated in the 1700s and 1800s, when European colonialists shipped home boatloads of tusks. Trading in African ivory has been banned since 1990, but illegal trade—largely for use in Asian “medicines”—has recently reached record levels, threatening the future of African elephants.</p>
