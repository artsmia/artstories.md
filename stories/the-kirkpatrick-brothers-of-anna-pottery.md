Were they American eccentrics? Visionary kooks out of step with the times? When Wallace and Cornwall Kirkpatrick, the brothers who founded Anna Pottery, came out with this rough-hewn jug, the American pottery scene had moved on to elegant vases with flower motifs and gauzy landscapes. But it’s too easy to write off the Kirkpatricks as provincial outliers. Their pottery was extremely popular. They were considered important regional artists, creating special flasks for distilleries and elaborate presentation pieces for state fairs. And they were power players in local politics: Cornwall was elected the first mayor of Anna, Illinois, where their pottery shop was located, and served three terms.

The Kirkpatrick’s progressive stance on everything from booze to race relations set them on a collision course with the conservative Victorian pieties and niceties of their time. Art reflected life: the brothers’ love affair with the lowbrow—basically anything below the belt, plus any animal considered dirty and disgusting—gleefully tweaked the fuddy-duddies in their midst.

Brother Wallace’s affection for snakes went beyond art to real obsession. He collected snakes, advertising for them in local farm journals and exhibiting them by the hundreds at Anna Pottery. A publicity stunt? Perhaps. But he seemed to genuinely like the slithery serpents.
