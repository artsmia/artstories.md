*The Tale of Genji*, considered the first novel in the history of literature, influenced not only the creation of screens and party games (where guests would test each other in identifying the various scenes depicted on a screen), but also the creation of *mitate*; parodies intended to cast an original story in a different light- again, relying on the viewer’s sense of play in searching for hidden or altered meanings. 

 

Here we see a mitate of Aoi, corresponding with Chapter 9.
