Terracotta figures excavated from burial mounds near Djenne in Mali share so many details with the wooden horseman—the same embroidered fabrics, necklaces, bracelets and anklets, and dotted scarification patterns near the eyes—that scholars believe they came from related workshops. Unfortunately, most of Mali’s archeological sites have been pillaged by looters, and information that may have confirmed a link is now lost.

Wood doesn’t usually stand a chance in West Africa, where bugs and humidity make quick work of it. So scholars were skeptical that this carving could be as old as its similarity to the terracotta figures suggests. But radiocarbon dating (which measures the amount of decayed radiocarbon in organic material) confirmed that it dates between 1425 and 1625. With the terracottas dated to between 1240 and 1460, the wooden horseman is thought to have been made around 1450.

The question of whether the sculpture was as well-preserved as it appears or had been restored was answered with a CAT scan in 2012: it was carved from a single piece of wood and has not been altered.
