Depictions of wars and battles are one of the oldest subjects of art— rulers love to document their victories.  Throughout history, artists found themselves in the much honored role of recording these events.  The artist was also charged with the responsibility of producing work to show the greatness of his or her country. Many works of war art depict victorious battles showcasing merits of strength, valor, and patriotism.

Around the 20th-century artists began shifting to document all faces of war—not just victories.  In fact, some governments would even commission artists for this purpose.  It was their job to combine both the artistic and the documentary elements of their subject to depict how war in totality shapes culture and life.
