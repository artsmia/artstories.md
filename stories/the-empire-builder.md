James J. Hill of St. Paul, hailed as the empire builder for his enterprising railroad ventures that stretched across the West, was also a keen-eyed collector of paintings. During the 1880s and '90s, he amassed more than 280 paintings.

Among Hill’s most daring and expensive purchases were Delacroix's *Convulsionists of Tangier* (\$25,000 in 1890) and Corot's *Silenus* (\$18,000 in 1912), both donated to the MIA by his grandson, Jerome Hill. Courbet’s *Deer in a Forest* was the first oil painting from the Hill collection to enter the MIA, in 1914.

Hill's interests extended beyond paintings to include sculpture by Antoine-Louis Barye and pastels by Jean-Francois Millet such as *The Church at Chailly* and *Watermill at the Foot of a Mountain, Allier*.

In 1915, Hill loaned 22 paintings to the MIA's opening exhibition, and it was hoped that his entire collection would form the core of the MIA's fledgling collection. But he died the following year without a will and his pictures were dispersed by lottery among his widow Mary Hill and his nine surviving children. The Millet pastels passed directly to Mary, and on to their daughter Rachel in 1921.

Through the generosity of his descendents, 29 of Hill's paintings and pastels have found their way to the MIA, from masterworks by Delacroix, Corot, and Jean-Francois Millet to this unexpected 16th-century *Madonna* by Joos van Cleve, which Hill had acquired in 1914 for his Roman Catholic spouse, Mary.
