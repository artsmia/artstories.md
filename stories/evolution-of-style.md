Matisse’s palette, painting technique, and artistic style continued to change and evolve over his career, sometimes quite drastically. Originally trained as a lawyer, Matisse pursued his interest in art at the age of 21 by following the traditional path of a professional artist – he moved to Paris and went to art school, ultimately studying at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts). His earliest work reflected his traditionalist training and is very un-Matisse. During the late 1890s, Paris’ art scene was active and dynamic and soon Matisse was experimenting with the diverse styles of the time including Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism.

Two summers spent at the beach were pivotal in Matisse’s career and style. In 1904, Matisse visited fellow artist Paul Signac in the south of France, where the bright light drastically changed Matisse’s palette to one of vivid colors. Signac introduced him to the Pointilist technique of using small dots of complementary colors to create dynamic works.

The following summer, working together in the small fishing port of Collioure (where he painted *Three Bathers* two years later), Matisse and painter André Derain introduced unnaturalistic color and vivid brushstrokes into their paintings. When their pictures were exhibited later that year in Paris, a witty critic called the works *fauves*, or "wild beasts" in his review, because the works were so striking compared with traditional French art of the time. The term stuck, and was later applied to the artists themselves.

Just a few years after helping launch the Fauvist movement, Matisse’s works were noticeably more subdued and ordered. This change began slowly in 1907, the year of *Three Bathers* or *Boy with a Butterfly Net*, both here at the MIA. The artist intentionally started to reduce the elements in his paintings, down to the most basic line, form, and color, often without any background and setting. His goal was to get to the “essential character of things.”

Matisse’s artistic endeavors followed varying paths in the years to follow. Trips to southern Spain, Russia, and Morocco inspired many of his works. The Cubist art of Spaniards Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, the jewel-like icons in Russia, and the brilliant light and color of the exotic land of Morocco captivated him.

In 1917, Matisse settled in Nice in the South of France, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Thus began a lengthy period in which he turned his focus to light: its effect as it fell on his female models and on the items he arranged in his house. He painted the female figure in various poses, states of undress, and different clothing. He also took to painting outdoors as a way to not only study the light, but to rejuvenate himself and his connection to nature.

In 1932, Dr. Albert Barnes, the Pennsylvania inventor who made millions off an antiseptic, commissioned Matisse to paint a large mural for his mansion outside of Philadelphia. Matisse chose the subject of the dance, a theme that had preoccupied him since the time of *Three Bathers*, and returned to many of the ideas he had labored over – the female figure, simplicity of form and line, and the “essential character of things.” To prepare for this great undertaking Matisse began using a new technique—that of building up the composition from cutout shapes of previously colored paper.

In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery for a tumor. Afterward, he remained in a wheelchair and drawing, book illustration, and cutouts were favored media of choice until his death in 1954.
