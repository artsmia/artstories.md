Attorney, banker, politician, and owner of one of the largest cotton plantations in the state of Mississippi—William McWillie had his hands full. McWillie and his wife, Catherine, built Kirkwood a few years after arriving in Mississippi from Camden, South Carolina, in about 1845. Only four years later, McWillie was elected to Congress, then went on to become governor of Mississippi from 1857 to 1859.  Meanwhile, Kirkwood had become one of the largest cotton plantations in the state, with nearly 200 enslaved African Americans.

Kirkwood was equipped with its own winery, bakery, and blacksmith shop, typical amenities of the antebellum, or prewar lifestyle of the South, run with materials produced by slave labor. Architecturally, Kirkwood also typical of the times: two stories, each with four large rooms, floor-to-ceiling windows, and pocket doors that allowed the rooms to be opened into one large space for parties. The McWillie family hosted many of the prominent Southern politicians of the day, including Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy.

Kirkwood eventually fell into ruin, and was demolished in the early 1900s. In her 1902 book, Historic Homes of Mississippi, Mrs. N.D. Dupress described Kirkwood Plantation as “A colonial pile with broad halls, large rooms, and conservatory, gardens and wide lawn. … It was taken down, the carved woodwork of the library was given to a church, together with the handsome stair-rail. ... Tall trees grow where once spacious halls and lofty rooms echoed.”
