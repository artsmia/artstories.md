In 1937, while his paintings hung in the infamous “Degenerate Art” exhibition organized by the Nazis in Munich, Beckmann and his wife left Germany for good. They made their way to Amsterdam, where his sister-in-law lived. Settling near the Jewish Quarter, they witnessed the deportation of the Amsterdam Jews. Beckmann referenced this in 1943, noting in his journal, “In the afternoon, went through deserted streets of Jewish homes.”

The Nazis invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. Fires burned and toilets backed up for days as people disposed of potentially compromising papers. Beckmann, too, destroyed diaries and letters, but he kept seven journals during his exile. They are conspicuously small, easily hidden, and names are often encoded or abbreviated.

Things took a turn for the worse after *dolle dinsdag*, the “Mad Tuesday” of September 5, 1944, when the citizens of Amsterdam waited in vain on roadsides, flowers in hand, for the Allies to liberate them. The German occupying powers responded with a naval blockade. Food became scarce. Gas and electricity were shut off.  Garbage collection ceased. In the brutal winter of 1944–45, 20,000 people died. “Nothing in itself will ever again become so impossible,” Beckmann wrote in his diary in April 1945, “as the state of want and dissolution here.”

Once a celebrated artist, Beckmann became anonymous in Amsterdam, frequenting its cafés and bars, alone, quietly observing people. In 1945, having reconnected with his New York dealer, he shipped his paintings to America and eventually made the journey himself, settling in St. Louis in 1947.

*Blind Man’s Buff* was painted between September 1944 and October 1945, a time of air raids and lack of food, coal, and electricity. Much of the triptych was painted by candlelight. This short video gives an idea of the conditions under which Beckmann worked in his attic studio.
