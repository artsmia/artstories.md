The predecessor to the T87 was the T77, also designed by Hans Ledwinka and introduced in 1934. That same year, Hitler hired Ferdinand Porsche to design a “people’s car”, or “Volkswagen.” Porsche borrowed liberally from Ledwinka to create the Volkswagen Beetle. “Well sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine,” was all Porsche said of it.

<span>Prototypes of the Beetle, also with a rear-mounted, air-cooled engine, started hitting the road in 1935. Ledwinka’s T87 left the factory in 1936. Formally titled the “KdF-Wagen,” the first official Volkswagen Beetles were manufactured in 1938 and their production slowed during World War II. </span>

Tatra sued Volkswagen over the Beetle design, claiming 11 patent infringements. The case was dropped when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, but Tatra won the suit after the war. Today, Tatra manufactures trucks, still with air-cooled engines. Production of the original Beetle ended in 2003. By then, Volkswagen had already introduced the New Beetle in 1997 and the Beetle A5 followed in 2011.
