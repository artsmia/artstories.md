John Bradstreet was a trendsetting designer in Minnesota, bringing the hottest styles from the coasts and interpreting them in his own way for prominent clients. He had an affinity for Japan, traveling there on regular buying trips for his shop, the Craftshouse, acquiring carvings, bronze cranes, and all manner of decorative objects.

Bradstreet so loved Japan that he designed a Japanese garden for the Craftshouse grounds, including a Japanese bridge from the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair. His idea to bankroll a Japanese garden on an island in Minneapolis’s Lake of the Isles was never realized, presumably because it didn’t mesh with the naturalistic approach of parks superintendent Theodore Wirth.

Bradstreet marketed his Craftshouse in Minneapolis as a unique place—“unlike anything of its kind in the country,” according to this 1905 brochure—and filled it with exotic furniture and other decorative objects for the home.

John Bradstreet helped found the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, the forerunner to the MIA, in 1883, and planned its early exhibitions. A year after Bradstreet’s death in a car accident, in 1914, sculptor Paul Fjelde memorialized him in this plaque.

Upon his death, Bradstreet bequeathed a group of Asian objects to the MIA, some of which the museum displayed in a special John Scott Bradstreet Memorial Room in 1915.
