<p>Sometimes an artwork can be too good to be true. That’s the question with this sculpture, which is so rare—only three exist in American museums—and so well preserved that some experts think it’s a fake. As you can imagine, the MIA wanted to know for sure, so we worked with a specialist to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>We put the head through CT scans, which revealed that it’s made of 16 clay fragments and that bits of quartz were mixed into the clay before it was sculpted. The quartz, which shows up as orange dots in the scan, is what makes her sparkle in the light.</p>

<p>The 16 fragments of terracotta clay show up as gray on this X-ray image while restored cement areas are highlighted in red.</p><p>Because the clay fragments are of even thickness and consistency, our expert concluded this is indeed the real thing—a hollow terracotta clay sculpture made more than 900 years ago in the kingdom of Ife (present-day Nigeria). That the bits of quartz are evenly distributed throughout the sculpture reinforces the conclusion.</p>
