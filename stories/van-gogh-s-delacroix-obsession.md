Van Gogh, like many Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, was profoundly influenced by Eugene Delacroix, the groundbreaking French painter. When Van Gogh moved to the south of France and began to paint his famous series of olive trees, he continuously referred to Delacroix and his art. “The murmur of an olive grove has something very intimate, immensely old about it,” he wrote to his brother Théo. “It is too beautiful for me to dare paint it or able to form an idea of it…the olive tree, if you want to compare it to something, is like Delacroix.”

While in the Saint-Paul Asylum, Van Gogh related his interest in olive groves and the people who worked them to his take on modern art: “a providential meeting of the very distant antiquities and raw modernity.” It was a principle he believed to be at the heart of Delacroix’s art.

Delacroix’s *Christ in the Garden of Olives*, from 1828, was one of his earliest religious subjects. It occupied a prominent place in the nave of a Paris church and was well known to Gauguin and Van Gogh, who was convinced that Delacroix had visited an olive grove during a trip to North Africa.

In 1888, Van Gogh was living in Arles, hoping to create his colony for artists. He asked his brother Théo, an art dealer, to send him prints of Delacroix’s *Pieta* to decorate the rooms of a little yellow house he’d prepared for Gauguin. The print he received was a black-and-white lithograph that reversed the original composition. Van Gogh copied it with oils in 1889, while in the asylum, using the brilliant yellows and blues that he associated with Delacroix’s spirituality.
