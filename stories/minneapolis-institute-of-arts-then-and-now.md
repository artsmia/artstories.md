From paper to plaster to stone, the MIA’s construction was brought together many visions and voices. With McKim, Mead, and White’s architectural plans in place, Clinton Morrison, one of the Society’s founding members, donated his family estate, Villa Rosa, as the site for the museum.

The MIA opened on January 7, 1915. Although only one-seventh of the original plan was built, the Society of Fine Arts was pleased to have a fine space to display and encourage the arts.

This postcard showing the MIA was likely made before the building was finalized, since it shows details that weren’t in the model or the original drawing, such as a stone retaining wall. The photo shows the building from Fair Oaks Park, around 1935.

Constructed from 1972 to 1974, Kenzo Tange’s two large modern wings were the first major addition to the MIA. Tange saw them as modern realizations of the original unbuilt east and west wings. These photos show the east wing construction from the outside, showing the link to the Children’s Theatre Company, and the interior main stair being built.

On June 11, 2006, the Target Wing, designed by Michael Graves, opened to the public. Though it is located alongside Tange’s west wing, the addition takes its architectural design cues from the exterior of the original McKim, Mead, and White building.
