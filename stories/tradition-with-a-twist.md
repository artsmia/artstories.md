The *Ars Moriendi*, or “The Art of Dying,” first appeared during the Black Death plagues and offered advice on how to die well. It was full of graphic illustrations, including an angel counseling a dying man at his bedside while demons struggled for a last chance at his soul. Versions of the book were popular across Europe for centuries after it first appeared in the 1400s, especially in Goya’s homeland of Spain.

Goya clearly borrowed some elements from the *Ars Moriendi* for the last of his many self-portraits—an ailing man in his bed, supported by a savior (here a doctor, not an angel). In this context, it is hard not to view the shadowy figures as demonic spirits.

By inscribing his thanks to Dr. Arrieta across the bottom of the painting, Goya evoked another type of devotional image, the *ex voto*. Normally an *ex voto* is made as an offering to a saint or divinity in gratitude for answering a prayer, with words of thanks penned beneath a picture illustrating the trouble.
