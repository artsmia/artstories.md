Rembrandt had two great loves in his life: his wife Saskia, who died at 29, and later his housekeeper and mistress, Hendrickje Stoffels. He and Hendrickje never married, since the destitute Rembrandt depended upon his inheritance from Saskia, which would have ended upon his remarriage. Hendrickje was publically reprimanded for living in sin with the painter shortly before the birth of their daughter Cornelia in 1654. Rembrandt had no head for business, and he relied on Hendrickje to manage his affairs. Her sudden death at age 38 during an outbreak of the plague in 1663 was a doubly devastating blow.

It is tempting to imagine that Rembrandt turned the tragic story of Lucretia into an outlet for his personal grief. He painted the story twice in three years after the death of his lover, and both of his Lucretias resemble Hendrickje.

The debate rages. Did Rembrandt intend to compare Hendrickje, steadfastly loyal in the face of public humiliation, to the virtuous Lucretia? Or do his Lucretias resemble Hendrickje simply because he had painted her so often? Or, does Lucretia resemble Hendrickje because the painter’s model was the couple’s 12-year-old daughter, Cornelia? The answers went to the grave with Rembrandt in 1669.
