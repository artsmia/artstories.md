If you’ve eaten at an Indian restaurant, you may recognize the Nataraja image. From posters to postcards to mini-bronze reproductions, the Nataraja is one of the most familiar visual associations with India today.

First and foremost, however, the Nataraja is an iconic image of Shiva dancing. In modern Bharatanatyam, a classical South Indian dance form, performers mimic this iconic pose—a movement one must see in person to fully appreciate its elegance and power. Here two dancers from Ragamala, the Minneapolis based dance company, capture this dramatic movement.
