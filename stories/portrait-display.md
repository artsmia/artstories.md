It’s a head without a home, at least in the collective imagination of scholars—how it was originally displayed is a bit of a mystery. Among the few clues is a ceramic pot dating to the same era, on which you can make out a similar-looking head under a canopy, placed alongside two less-realistic heads. This implies that the people of Ife set portrait heads like this one on shrines and honored them with offerings.
