During the Han dynasty, imperial envoys to Central Asia returned to court marveling over a breed of “heavenly horse” popular out west. It was a stout steed, they said, with a powerful back and shoulders with such stamina that they sweated blood and kept on churning.

At the time, the Chinese were threatened by horse-riding invaders from the west. So the Chinese Emperor Wu, who reigned from 141–87 BCE, became obsessed with these “heavenly horses” as a way to match the threat. Diplomats were dispatched, and later the military, to bring some back.

The fabled “blood sweating” horse reportedly hailed from the Fergana region in present-day Uzbekistan. This area was a horseman’s paradise, famous for exceptional steeds that were the envy of the Chinese to the east.

Could the Fergana horse have actually sweated blood, as the admiring Chinese claimed? Researchers today believe it’s possible, for two very different reasons, neither of them good: parasites under the skin or possibly burst blood vessels after a hard gallop.

Horses became very popular subjects in Chinese art, partly due to the Han rulers’ interest in these fabled animals from the west.
