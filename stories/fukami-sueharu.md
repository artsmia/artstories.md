Born in Kyoto in 1947, Fukami Sueharu belongs to a generation of ceramic artists in postwar Japan devoted to the creation of sculptural ceramics, without adhering to traditional forms.  Before reaching the perfection of his pale-blue sculptures, Fukami traversed a “stony” path. Although he was fascinated by pale bluish glazed porcelain early on, there was a period when he experimented with stoneware and different ash glazes to create very different conceptual works.

The avant-garde movement Sōdeisha (Society for Mud Crawling) was founded in 1948 to openly question the concept of functionality within ceramic art and to promote ceramics without boundaries. In 1973, under the influence of this movement, Fukami created unglazed stoneware of Gotomaki clay with the theme of “information.” Each work is decorated with newsprint.

*Seascape II*, a small, delicate piece, provided the starting point for the collection of more than 80 pieces that Willard G. “Bill” Clark amassed and later gave to Mia. Bill still vividly remembers his instant fascination with this graceful sculpture and his trip to Fukami’s studio in Kyoto in 2002, where he convinced the artist to let go of his early works.
