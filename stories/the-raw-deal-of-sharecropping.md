When slaves were freed after the Civil War, many remained on plantations—as sharecroppers. This is likely what William Howard and his family did at Kirkwood Plantation. They didn’t have much choice: The South was devastated and farming was about the only good use of the land. Also, they didn’t own any. So plantation owners offered a deal to their former slaves: work part of the land in return for a share of the crop. Not surprisingly, this wasn’t a great deal for the freed men, who toiled just as hard as before at the whim of the landowners.

Howard is listed on the U.S. Census of 1870 just a few entries above Catherine McWillie and her remaining household (William McWillie died in 1869). The census indicates that Howard was a 65-year-old farm laborer born in Africa. His household included 60-year-old Sally Howard, presumably Howard’s wife, and 16-year-old Henry Howard, possibly their son, a farm laborer born in Mississippi. The difficult economic times are reflected in Howard’s use of make-do materials such as cotton crates and tobacco boxes for large but hidden portions of the writing desk.
