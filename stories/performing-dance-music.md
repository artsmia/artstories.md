What do healing rituals, political events, public entertainment, and initiation ceremonies have in common? They are usually accompanied by music. And music creates movement: in the rhythm of the beat, the motion of musicians’ fingers, or the accompanying dance.

Performance, dance and movement have shaped these African art galleries, and are perhaps most boldly manifested in the masks, costumes, and dance accessories from across the continent.
