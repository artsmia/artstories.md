Giovanni Battista Piranesi believed he could do anything he put his mind to—and he did. "I need to produce great ideas,” he once declared, “and I believe that if I were commissioned to design a new universe, I would be mad enough to undertake it." He was an avid archaeologist, yet the historical record proved no hindrance to his imagination: he fabricated elaborate fantasies of ancient cityscapes, adhering only vaguely to the evidence.

In his prints and drawings, Piranesi imagined fantastical worlds of looming architecture and grand monuments. His *Views of Rome* exaggerated the size of ancient Roman monuments—in stark contrast to the realism of his contemporaries, such as Canaletto and Tiepolo. In his *Prisons* series, he constructed brooding, maze-like dungeons that suggested an awe-inspiring immensity.

The realistic depiction of Canaletto's *Grand Canal from Palazzo Flangini to Palazzo Bembo* is a stark contrast to Piranesi's imaginative thinking.
