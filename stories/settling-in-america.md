Soon after Beckmann arrived in America, the City Art Museum of St. Louis (now the St. Louis Art Museum) organized his first American retrospective.

After Mia acquired "Blind Man's Buff," museum director Richard Davis contacted Mathilde (Quappi) Beckmann for more information about the painting.\

*August 2^nd^, 1954*

*Dear Dick, many thanks for your letter from July 23^rd^. I am very happy to know that “Blindman’s Buff” is honored by the display in a single room, I am sure Max would have appreciated that very much!*

*About the symbolic meaning of the triptych, I can refer you to what Perry o wrote in his St. Louis catalogue, it is authentic, as he had interviewed Max before he had written it. I could add, perhaps, that Max also called his figures in the center panel “the gods” in contrast to the people on the side panels engaged in worldly activities and interests, except the two opposite figures, the kneeling woman and the blindfolded man—both seeking their destiny, will \[sic\] say in this case, finding each other. Will they? Max said: “Perhaps—let us hope it.” But do they know each other? “Of course not. Not yet.” The side panels are meant as the worldly enjoyments, activities and behaviors of those people, who look only for the satisfaction of their sense-organs, (again except of the two I have mentioned before.) The center panel represents the Art; music, music in itself as well performed, Art (every Art) as a gift of God and also Art as one of His manifold expressions. Therefore he called those figures “the gods.” What Perry said is also true and Max agreed. The passion of the man with the horsehead mask for the beauty in her ermine cape—a variation of Jupiter and Venus.*

*I think that is about all, maybe you knew all that anyway?*

*Meanwhile best wishes and regards to both of you,*

*Cordially, Quappi*
