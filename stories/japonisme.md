It was like nothing they had seen before. Japanese imports began flooding European shores after Japan’s ports had reopened to trade in the mid-1800s: woodblock prints, screens, scrolls, and decorative objects that both awed and inspired French artists. Japanese items were displayed at the 1867 World Exhibition in Paris and local art dealers took advantage of the interest this spurred to start selling Japanese prints. This Japanese influence on French art became known as Japonisme.

Japanese art impressed Impressionist painters like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas with its depiction of normal, everyday subjects in a decorative way. In a letter to his brother, painter Vincent Van Gogh wrote, “My studio’s quite tolerable, mainly because I’ve pinned a set of Japanese prints on the walls that I find very diverting.”

Woodcut prints by masters of *ukiyo-e* (Japanese “pictures of the floating world”) were incredibly popular in Europe. They were affordable and available in mass quantities. Impressionist artists, in particular, were captivated by their decorative and flattened style as well as the mundane or everyday subjects they depicted.

Every artist inspired by Japanese art took something a little different from it. Degas adopted its style, if not its subject matter: extended layouts, uneven arrangements, aerial perspectives. Mary Cassatt, an American painter and a friend of Degas, reconsidered her own portrayal of women after seeing how their everyday lives were depicted in *ukiyo-e* prints.

*Ukiyo-e* prints also inspired French artists to produce series of artworks meditating on the same subject from various perspectives, a classic Japanese convention in the mode of Katsushika Hokusai’s *Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji* (1826–33). Monet owned an extensive collection of Japanese woodblock prints and pursued several different series, from grainstacks to poplar trees to the Japanese bridge on his estate.
