<p>It’s a typical story: boy meets girl, girl rejects boy, boy puts a spell on her prize sheep. Though in the strange and beguiling story told in these tusk carvings, the boy is the Obi of Oboro, a sorcerer-ruler, and the girl is engaged to marry Oba Akengbud, another ruler. Here she has unwittingly followed her charmed ram to the Obi of Oboro, who’s wielding “packets” of magic to lure her.</p>

<p>It doesn’t work.</p><p>Girl rejects boy again. Boy has her killed. And then <i>he’s</i> killed—by Agboghidi, a professional invincible warrior, under orders from Oba Akengbuda to avenge the death of his fiancé. Never mind that Agboghidi is the adopted son of the Obi he was asked to kill. Orders are orders.</p>

<p>Here’s where it gets Shakespearean. Imaran, the warrior on the right, sneaks into Agboghidi’s room at night, steals the Obi’s head (sealed in a leather box) and takes it to Oba Akengbuda, claiming credit for the killing. He’s rewarded—naturally upsetting Agboghidi, who declares war on Akengbuda. How much is true? What’s certain is that the region’s rulers at the time were at each other’s throats, and a long civil war began.</p>
