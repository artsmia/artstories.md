Street art like Swoon’s is a subset of the broader category of “graffiti,” any writing or drawing illicitly applied in a public place. Just as here she has covered the work of another graffiti artist with her pasted print, Swoon fully expects that her own work will be short-lived, as it decays with exposure to the elements or becomes engulfed by other layers of life in that place.

Like many other street artists, Swoon affixes her prints to a surface using wheat paste, a cheap and surprisingly durable homemade paste of flour and water (or its manufactured equivalent). “Wheatpastes” have become a distinct genre of graffiti, popular among street artists because the glue does not do permanent damage. On the flip side, they do not last long and undergo a process of decay which Swoon relishes as it occurs. A museum gallery installation cannot capture all the nuances of street art, but it can protect and preserve the physical record of its essence.
