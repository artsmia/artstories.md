Mia’s Tatra was bought in Brussels, Belgium, in 1948, and exported to Canada in the 1950s. With Czechoslovakia, where the car was made, under Soviet rule, parts were hard to come by. A Canadian collector purchased the Tatra in 1991 and rebuilt the engine, restored and repainted the body and dashboard, and restored the original leather seats.

The Tatra company’s advertising stressed its speed, power, and streamlined design, as seen on the cover of the 1948 Tatra T87 sales brochure.
