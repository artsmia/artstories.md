The word “aquamanile” comes from the Latin words for water (aqua) and hand (manus), and is used to describe water containers—often in the form of animals—designed for ritual hand washing. The tradition arose among Muslims in the Middle East around 700 CE and was later brought to Europe, where Christians adopted it. Some scholars have theorized that Benin adapted the leopard-shaped vessel from European aquamaniles brought by Dutch and Portuguese traders.

**Very early aquamaniles, such as this eagle, were introduced to Europe from Islamic Egypt, Persia, and the lands of ancient Mesopotamia as trade items and war booty. This particular example is from Mesopotamia.

In Europe, aquamaniles were adopted for Christian ritual hand washing. They were commonly modeled after animals found in bestiaries, illustrated books of information (sometimes truthful, sometimes fanciful) about the animal world.

This detail from a German illuminated manuscript shows the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, washing his hands with a dragon-shaped aquamanile as he sentences Jesus to death.  Pilate is portrayed as a medieval European ruler, and the aquamanile he holds is typical of that time.

Benin’s rulers enjoyed cozy relations with Europeans, who they saw as useful trading partners and, sometimes, military allies. They even portrayed them in their royal art—like the long-haired, bearded man on this royal tusk.

Europeans may have brought aquamaniles to Benin as gifts to the king. But royal histories of Benin credit Ewuare the Great, who ruled from, around 1440 to 1473, with introducing the idea after finding ritual vessels in an underwater palace belonging to Olokun, the god of the sea. Two interpretations of the same events? You decide.
