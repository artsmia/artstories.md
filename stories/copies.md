The *Gulshan-i ‘Ishq* was frequently illustrated for about 150 years after it was written in 1657 and many of these works are in museum collections. A complete manuscript in the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s (PMA) collection is believed to be based on the dispersed manuscript to which the MIA’s folio belonged and even includes translucent paper with tracings of images, likely used to make copies. The MIA’s folio may have been copied through such tracings.

More pages from the MIA’s *Gulshan* manuscript have turned up in other art collections, including the San Diego Museum of Art, The Khalili (Nour) Collection in London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These include the page below from the Met’s collection, which represents another lover’s tale from the *Gulshan*, that of Prince Manohar and Princess Madhulamati.  Manohar slumbers in a bed and his nursemaid sleeps below him. Outside the palace, nine flying angels hover overhead, preparing to transport the sleeping prince to the abode of Princess Madhulamati, who they have determined to be his perfect match.
