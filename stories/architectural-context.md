While we don’t know the exact location of the yogini temple, recent research suggests it was located near Kanchipuram in the present-day Indian state of Tamil Nadu.  Still-standing Yogini temples from around the same time are circular and open to the sky, evoking the shape of a yogini chakra, which in yogic theory is an energy center along the spinal column of the body.

The yogini, all by herself, is a powerful expression of Shakti, the feminine energy that causes all action in the universe. In the company of her fellow goddesses, perhaps as many as 108—a sacred number in India—their force would have created a truly sublime devotional experience. A devotee entering the temple would have felt hundreds of eyes trained upon her as she walked around the sacred space, receiving strength and courage from the watchful yoginis’ gaze.

Texts from around 600 to 1100 describe early rituals in which fierce yoginis were invited into circles, treated to liquor, animal meat, and blood, and became consorts of Tantric practitioners. This remarkable painting shows a Tantric rite on a cremation ground: through his chanting, the practitioner at left has transformed himself into the god Shiva and summoned the fearsome and beautiful goddess Bhairavi. Sitting on a rotting corpse, Bhairavi reveals her true form: horned and wearing jewelry made of skulls, she holds symbols of destruction in three hands and makes a sign of benediction with her fourth.
