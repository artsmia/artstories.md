Zulu pots are no plastic beer cups. Zulu potters go to great lengths to create them from uniformly small particles of clay, so the pots are smoother, stronger, and more malleable in the making. They’ll get the clay from secret locations, dry it, grind it on a flat stone, and sift it with a sieve before adding water.

A potter starts with a flattened clay disc, adding coils of clay to form the body of the pot. As it develops, she smooths and thins the walls with tools.

Finished and partly dried, the pot is carved with decorations and burnished with a smooth stone and a little water to create a shiny surface.

The pots are first fired as a group in a shallow firepit of dried cow dung, aloe leaves, wood, and grass. The fire can reach 1,652 degrees Farenheit (900 degrees Celsius).

Beer pots used at family drinking parties get a second firing on a pile of dried grasses and other materials. The smoke darkens the outside, creating the black surface attractive to ancestors.
