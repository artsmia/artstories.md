Alberto Santos-Dumont was born in 1873 in Brazil to wealthy coffee producers. He was the first to design, build, and fly the first dirigible, or air ship that could be controlled in flight.

After taking his first flight in an air balloon in 1897, Santos-Dumont became enchanted with flight.  Not only did he order an air balloon to be made for himself, but he also began designing his own.  He is attributed with having designed the first practical dirigible air ship, an air balloon that could be controlled in the air.  He became famous worldwide after flying his lighter-than-air ship around the Eiffel tower in 1901.

After his success with airships, he created a heavier ship, called the 14-Bis. Also known as the Bird of Prey plane, this ship ran on wheels for lift off and featured two sets of wings stacked above one another.  By 1906 Santo-Dumont had performed the first unaided lift off of a heavier-than-air plane.

This statue, located in front of the Rio De Janerio airport, pays tribute to Santo-Dumont’s innovations in flight. A man stands tall at the top of the monument, spreading his impressive wings with the help of other figures crawl up from the bottom to prop up his innovation. Two figures lay at the base of the statue symbolizing those that were lost in quest for air travel.
