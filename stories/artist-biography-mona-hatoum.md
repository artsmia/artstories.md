Hatoum started her career producing video and performance art. Her work was intensely political and she often used her own body to represent the gendered aspects of domestic spaces.  By the late 1980s Hatoum turned to sculpture and interactions that asked viewers to become involved in viewing her work. In this way, she shifted her focus from delivering a direct message to asking her audience to take responsibility for their interpretation.
