Early photographers tried to take pictures that looked like paintings. By the late 1960s, painters were trying to reproduce photographs.

The Photorealists were more focused on meticulously approximating the look of photos than any particular subject matter, and ranged from portraits to still lifes to advertising images to scenes from everyday life. They employed various mechanical aids: grids, projectors, airbrushes, transfer paper—whatever helped them reproduce the photographic look in another artistic medium.
